# Machine_Learning-Housing_grade_prediction_using_python
Machine learning is widely used to build predictive models for data analysis.
The dataset consists of a training file that we use to train the algorithm to make predictions over the test file. 
The file contains about 2500+ missing values. 
We use KNN Imputation to autofill the missing places for better prediction. 
the model used to make predictions on training and testing dataset is SVM.
the accuracy of the model obtained by using linear kernel is about 88.6% and is 23% more than that of rbf.
