# Machine_Learning-Housing_grade_prediction_using_python
Machine learning is widely used to build predictive models for data analysis. The dataset consists of a training file that we use to train the algorithm to make predictions over the test file. The file contains about 2500+ missing values. We use KNN Imputation to autofill the missing places for better prediction. The model used to train the machâ€¦
